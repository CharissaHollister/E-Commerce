Configure the Sequelize ORM in a Node.js application.

Create models for categories, products, and tags in a relational database and a through table that will connect the product and tag models.

Define and implement CRUD methods, using Sequelize to interact with your models in each API endpoint through proper RESTful commands (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Create and implement Sequelize associations to join tables.

Use environment variables to protect sensitive data, such as your MySQL username and password.

AS A manager at an internet retail company  
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
